## Hi! I'm Ryan

I am currently working as a Quantitative Analyst at Wells Fargo, primarily
focusing on risk model research, development, maintenance, and monitoring. In
much of my free time, I work on mathematical, statistical, and programming
hobby projects.

Feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, or ideas and I'll try to
respond reasonably quickly!
