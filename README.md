## Hi! I'm Ryan

I am currently a Quantitative Analyst at Wells Fargo, where I focus on
researching, developing, and monitoring risk models across a broad range of
asset classes. In my free time, I enjoy working on mathematical, statistical,
and programming hobby projects.

Feel free to reach out via email with any questions, comments, or ideas. I aim
to respond reasonably quickly!
